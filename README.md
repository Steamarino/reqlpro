## What is ReQLPro?

ReQlPro is an open-source GUI for RethinkDB databases. Our tool makes it dramatically simpler to view, organize, and manage your data.


## Features

- **Run Custom Queries** -- Control how you view your data with custom query inputs that accept any valid ReQL filter or orderBy statements.
- **Manage Multiple RethinkDB Connections** -- ReQLPro gives you the ability to manage several RethinkDB connections at the same time.
- **Easily Add and Modify Records** -- It's a breeze to add, update and delete records from your RethinkDB instance.

## Why ReQLPro?

When we first utilized RethinkDB as our datastore of choice on a new project, only one of our team members took the time to dig in and learn the ins-and-outs. As soon as other devs on the team needed to start tweaking values in the database, we hit a problem. RethinkDB didn't have an admin GUI, like Robomongo and Psequel, that we had been accustomed to using on other projects. This meant that everyone had to start pulling up Rethink docs, and learning the query syntax to update/delete/etc records, slowing down the efforts of front-end developers that otherwise don't need to know the query language of the database.

We decided to fix this problem for ourselves by building a native admin UI for RethinkDB. After sharing it with a few friends we realized that this could help a lot of developers. So, we put in the extra effort to release a version of it to the public.
